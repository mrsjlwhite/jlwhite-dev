    about: `
            Hi! My name's Jeslyn and I’m a self-taught software developer with a passion for developing beautiful, user-friendly applications. 
            I had started a masters program that I realized wasn't for me, and decided to change to web development.
            Since I changed my career in 2017, my interest and admiration for programming has only grown, as programming has become a beloved past time and practice for me.
            During this time, I’ve developed an ethic of building clean, reusable, and high-quality code as I strive to keep with current best practices. 
            I enjoy working on solo work as well as collaborative projects, as long as I get to code. ☕️💻

        I'm a wannabe gamer who loves roguelites and farming sims, and who loves to go on hikes with her hubby and fur-baby. 🐾
